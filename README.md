# Tanner Arnold - Development Blog

Hi there, I'm Tanner Arnold. I'm a young developer early in my career, still figuring out who I am and what life has in store for me. I go with either _he/him_ or _they/them_ pronouns.

## Who Am I?

My passion is for software and understanding how things work underneath the hood. I've dabbled in many programming languages as a personal endeavour, but my professional living is dealing in C#, .NET, JavaScript / TypeScript and SQL.

I'm a nerd by trade, and that extends to my hobbies as well. When I'm not programming, I'm playing video games which make me think, playing tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons, and singing and acting in a local musical theatre troupe / choir.
