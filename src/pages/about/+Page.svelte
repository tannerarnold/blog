      Tanner's professional experience in Typescript, C#, and SQL, as well as a
      deep understanding of systems architecture are a welcome addition to any
      team looking for someone who is willing to dive in to difficult and
      complex issues. Tanner really shines under direction, and his ability to
      dive into a codebase and discover obscure issues within a codebase are
      second to none.

      When he is not programming for fun, and enjoying the challenges of a good
      problem to solve, he enjoys playing video games like Civilization and
      Minecraft, solving various Rubik's Cubes, playing Dungeons & Dragons and
